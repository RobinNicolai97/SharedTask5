Hey team,

I wanted to share with you the BI0 code I worked on.

The output of this code is in BI0_Train.txt.

Take a look at it, it might help. 

I had a hard time writing this code and it's not perfect yet. 


The code might be complicated too.. 

the main issue is interpunction now. 

For toxic spans, I told the sytem to do a \newline when switching from toxic to non-toxic spans. This was fairly easy.

However, for non toxic spans I couldn't do that.
This is because both the word and interpunction were non-toxic and this therefore can't be distuingished. It is also a problem in fully toxic messages '[]',
because also there you can't check for different annotation (because all is toxic). 
That's why I told the system to do a \newline when a character is not alphabetic.

This messes up words like F*ck. Also mentions because of the @. 
I hardcoded the model so that it would leave URL's unharmed. Those work fine now. 

Hope you can manage to get this working. Good luck!
